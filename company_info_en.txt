## Product Lineup

Question: What products do you manufacture?
Answer: We manufacture natural soaps (fruit-shaped soaps, herbal soaps, scrub soaps, spa soaps, tuk-tuk car-shaped soaps), bath products (bath bombs, bubble bars, bubble bath gels), skincare products (scrubs, shampoos, shower gels, body lotions), and home fragrances (room sprays, diffuser oils).

Question: What are the characteristics of natural soaps?
Answer: SABOO THAILAND natural soaps contain a large amount of premium coconut cold process oil and are 100% handcrafted by Thailand's top soap artisans. They are aged for over 4 weeks at temperatures above 30°C to completely neutralize alkaline components, and naturally generated glycerin gently cares for rough skin.

Question: What is the difference between MP soap and cold process soap?
Answer: MP (Melt & Pour) soap has natural glycerin as its main component, providing excellent moisturizing effects and maintaining moisture even after use. Despite high glycerin content, it maintains a firm texture through SABOO's special technology. It can be made in various designs from fruit shapes to rectangles.

## Bath Products

Question: Please tell me how to use bath bombs.
Answer: Fill the bathtub with warm water (37-40°C) first, then add the bath bomb. You'll hear a 'fizzing' sound as it dissolves, spreading color and fragrance. After bathing for about 15 minutes, gently pat dry with a towel without additional showering.

Question: How do I use bubble bars?
Answer: Fill the bathtub about 1/4 full while placing the bubble bar under the running tap, creating friction with the flowing water to generate bubbles. Stronger water pressure creates richer bubbles. After use, a light shower is needed to remove bubble residue.

Question: What are the characteristics of bubble bath gel?
Answer: It's a gel type with high usability, creating rich and long-lasting bubbles. A small amount is sufficient to generate adequate bubbles.

Question: Are there any tips for creating rich bubbles?
Answer: Use strong water pressure and fill the bathtub only about 1/4 before adding the bubble bar. Use it while filling with water, and adding strong water flow with a showerhead will create even richer bubbles.

## Ingredients and Safety

Question: What ingredients are in natural soaps?
Answer: They contain palmitic acid (natural fatty acid extracted from coconut/palm oil), stearic acid (enhances skin flexibility), lauric acid (from coconut oil with antibacterial effects), glycerin (100% natural Thai), sorbitol (natural moisturizer), and cocamidopropyl betaine (EWG Grade 1 coconut-derived surfactant).

Question: What are the main ingredients in bath bombs?
Answer: They contain baking soda (pH control, exfoliation, sebum suppression), citric acid (skin pH control, moisturizing), corn starch (soothes dry skin), tartaric acid (natural fruit acid from grapes), malic acid (natural AHA from apples), sweet almond oil, jojoba oil, and vitamin E.

Question: How is product safety ensured?
Answer: We use only IFRA-registered fragrances and keep harmful components (Lilial, Hydroxycitronellal, etc.) below legal standards. We use food-grade safe colors and exclude SLS, parabens, silicone, and sodium chloride. We use EWG Grade 1 coconut-derived surfactants.

Question: Can people with sensitive skin use these products?
Answer: Yes, we have products using EWG Green grade ingredients with certified 0.00 skin irritation. Using only food-grade ingredients makes them very safe, but we recommend patch testing (apply a small amount on the inner arm and observe for 24-48 hours).

## Skin Type Guide

Question: Are there products suitable for dry skin?
Answer: Yes, we have products with 100% Thai glycerin providing deep moisturization. They contain plant oils like olive oil, jojoba oil, and avocado oil, maintaining moisture even without additional showering after bathing. Shea butter also enhances skin flexibility.

Question: What products do you recommend for oily skin?
Answer: We recommend sebum-control bath bombs. They contain baking soda for pH control and sebum suppression, providing a light and refreshing feel. We recommend using 2-3 times per week.

Question: Can children use these products?
Answer: Yes, they can be used from children to adults. However, please follow precautions: absolutely no ingestion, use under adult supervision, store out of children's reach, and start with smaller amounts than adult portions.

## Bath Bomb and Bath Product Usage and Precautions

Question: What is the appropriate bathing time?
Answer: 15-20 minutes is the appropriate bathing time. The ideal temperature is 37-40°C, and it should feel comfortably warm when tested with your elbow.

Question: Are there any precautions for use?
Answer: Be careful of slipperiness due to oil content. Avoid wounds or eczema areas, always check expiration dates, and bathroom ventilation is essential. If red spots, swelling, or itching occur, stop use immediately and rinse with running water.

Question: Can pregnant women or infants use these products?
Answer: Pregnant women should check product-specific precautions before use, and careful use is recommended for infants under 12 months. Patch testing is essential for eczema patients, and dermatologist consultation is recommended.

Question: Are there precautions for 3-year-old children?
Answer: For 3-year-old children, we recommend testing on the back of the hand before use. Children have more sensitive skin than adults, so pre-testing is always necessary.

Question: I'm worried about allergies. How can I check?
Answer: Fragrance or color raw materials may contain allergens you're unaware of. If you're curious about specific ingredients, you can check the product's ingredient list. If you have known allergies, always check ingredients before use.

## Bathtub Care and Storage

Question: Will the bathtub get stained?
Answer: SABOO products use water-soluble dyes, minimizing staining risk. Clean the bathtub immediately after use and maintain regular bathtub care.

Question: Please tell me how to clean different types of bathtubs.
Answer: For acrylic bathtubs, use baking soda + water paste with soft sponges. For enamel bathtubs, use neutral detergent + baking soda (avoid strong abrasives). For artificial marble, use neutral detergent and baking soda + vinegar mixture. For natural marble, use only pH-neutral detergents and absolutely avoid acidic cleaners.

Question: Please tell me how to store products.
Answer: Store in low humidity, cool places away from direct sunlight in dark areas. Well-ventilated areas are better than bathrooms. Completely dry products after use before storing.

Question: Are there ways to utilize leftover products?
Answer: You can put small pieces in cloth bags as air fresheners or use them for foot/hand baths in basins. They can also be used for cleaning with baking soda components, but caution is needed.
